What is CI, CD & CDE?
-

- Continuous Integration (CI): the practice of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository, followed by an automated build and testing process to catch and resolve issues early on.

- Continuous Delivery (CD): the practice of automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes to a staging or production environment.

- Continuous Deployment (CDE): the practice of automatically deploying code changes directly to production without human intervention, assuming that all tests and quality checks have passed.

What is Jenkins?
-

- Jenkins is a popular open-source automation tool used for continuous 
integration and continuous delivery. It provides a wide range of plugins that can be used to automate various aspects of the software development process, such as building, testing, and deploying code changes.

- Other tools that can be used for CI/CD include GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, CircleCI, and AWS CodePipeline, among others.

Jenkins stages:
-

- Jenkins stages refer to the different phases or steps in a Jenkins pipeline. A pipeline is a collection of stages that define the steps required to build, test, and deploy code changes. 
- Each stage represents a particular phase of the pipeline, such as building the code, running tests, and deploying to a staging environment.

What is the difference between continuous delivery (CD) and Continuous Deployment (CDE)?
-

- The main difference between CD and CDE is that CD stops at deploying changes to a staging environment, while CDE deploys changes directly to production. 
- CD allows for human approval before deploying changes to production, while CDE assumes that all necessary tests and quality checks have been passed and deploys changes automatically.
